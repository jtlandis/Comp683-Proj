## Getting setup

```{r}
#| eval: false

# unless you are starting an R session
# from within this directory, source
# the `.Rprofile` from the project root.
source(".Rprofile")

# If running for the first time use the code below to setup SLICER by installing dependencies
# ## SLICER and some other dependencies are no longer on CRAN, thus they must be installed manually
box::use(mods/setup_SLICER[...])

# If you have run the above, future work may be called by doing the above again or the below:
library(SLICER) # traditional
box::use(SLICER[...]) # using `box::use()`
```
